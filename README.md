# Prosopis Biomass estimation models

A brief script to train a Biomass Estimation Models (BEM) using GLM functions and data available for several species of the Prosopis genera.

The code shows the advantages and disadvantages of univarant and multivariant models for Prosopis pallida

The complete database shows that differences in allometric questions are mainly explained by the forest type (planted or natural) rather than the species or the environmental conditions.

Using allometric equations depends on the size of the tree biomass you want to estimate and the range of data used to build the equations.
